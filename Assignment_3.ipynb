    "**Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the training data into subsets based on the values of different attributes. The algorithm makes decisions by following a tree-like model where each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label. The decision tree classifier algorithm can be summarized in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the Best Attribute: The algorithm starts with the entire dataset as the root node. It then evaluates different attributes and selects the one that best separates the data into different classes. The selection of the best attribute is typically based on metrics like information gain, Gini index, or gain ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting the Dataset: Once the best attribute is selected, the dataset is split into subsets based on the possible values of the selected attribute. This process is repeated for each subset, creating a recursive tree-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Missing Values: Decision trees can handle missing values by either assigning the most common value of the attribute, using the mean or median value, or employing other strategies depending on the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping Criteria: The algorithm stops splitting the nodes further based on certain criteria. This can include reaching a maximum depth for the tree, having a minimum number of samples in a node, or achieving homogeneity (when all data points in a node belong to the same class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning Labels: Once the tree is built, each leaf node is assigned a class label based on the majority class of the data points in that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making Predictions: To make predictions on new data, the algorithm traverses the decision tree by following the conditions defined in each internal node until it reaches a leaf node, which provides the predicted class label for the input data point."
